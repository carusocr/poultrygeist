Initial goals:

1. Navigate to site
2. Select local weekly circular.
3. Parse JS table generated upon category selection.

Future goals:

1. Clean up output into something more readable. Sorting by price isn't necessarily useful
	since categories aren't perfectly clear.
2. Integrate into todo list? Thinking something like:
	"Search for usual suspects" will perform search of standard keyword set.
	"Custom search" will let you fill out a small form and submit it as search terms.
	Either option will then...redirect to a results table?
